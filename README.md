## description
The currency converter visually and functionally consists of three parts (form fieldsets):
1. exchange rates
2. converter of foreign currencies on Polish zloty
3. converter of Polish zloty on foreign currencies

Currently there are four foreign currencies:
- Euro (EUR)
- US Dollar (USD)
- Swiss Franc (CHF)
- Pound Sterling (GBP)

which are selected within a "select" form attribute. 

The currency converter results are updated on each "input" event.

At present the exchange rates in this project are constant values.
